## Homework 1: Madlibs

For this assignment, you'll create your own Startup Generator app. Open the files in the [madlib with loops folder](starter-code/madlib-with-loops) and start by reading the "instructions.md" file. You'll learn how to use helper methods and for loops. We have provided some starter code; while we haven't covered functions and DOM manipulation yet, this is a good chance for you to challenge yourself and get a head start on these topics.

### Bonus Homework(Optional): Code Challenges

Its always good to practice and what better way than code challenges. When doing code challenges, try to break down what you need to do in small steps. It is important to try and not google the answer right away. Instead google the smaller step you need help with so in that way you are still attempting the larger problem yourself.
